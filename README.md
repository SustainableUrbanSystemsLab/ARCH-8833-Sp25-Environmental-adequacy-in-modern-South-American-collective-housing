Required software for running experiment:
Rhinoceros 8, ClimateStudio.

Times chosen for analysis:
1. 09:00 AM
2. 15:00 PM

Dates chosen for analysis:
1. 21 June (Winter solstice)
2. 22 September (Equinox)
3. 21 December (Summer solstice)

Modeling generalizations:
1. Simple walls were modeled with a thickness of 18 centimeters and double or reinforced walls were modeled
with 25 centimeters.
2. Windows were considered to have 120 centimeters of height and a sill height of 105 centimeters.
3. Slabs were considered 15 centimeters thick.
4. Glazing was modeled without thickness.
5. Brise-soleil were modeled using a grasshopper component (appendix A)
6. Musharabya were modeled using a grasshopper component (appendix B)
7. Simulations considered all doors open.
8. Simulations accounted for all floorplate area discounted walls.

Grasshoppper definitions for generating standardized musharabya and brise-soleil are also attached.

Materials used:
1. Matte White Wall
2. Wood Floor
3. Clear-clear glazing
4. Dupont Clay

Ground albedo setting: 0,2
