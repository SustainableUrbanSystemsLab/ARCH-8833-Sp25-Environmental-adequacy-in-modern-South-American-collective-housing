# ‚òÄÔ∏è Daylight Analysis in South American Modern Housing (1950‚Äì1954)

Welcome to the official repository for the study **‚ÄúEnvironmental adequacy in modern South American collective housing: comparative analysis of daylight in six projects (1950‚Äì1954)‚Äù** by Jo√£o Navarrete de Almeida. The material was developed for Patrick Kastner's course on Data Driven Methods for Sustainable Architecture at GeorgiaTech. This repository contains all the data, simulation tools, and analysis scripts needed to **replicate or extend** the pilot daylighting study of six modernist housing projects in Rio de Janeiro and Caracas.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Description

This project examines claims made by the 1955 MoMA exhibition *Latin American Architecture Since 1945*, which argued that regional modernism incorporated effective environmental controls. Using computational daylight simulations, this study evaluates **six tropical housing projects** to test those claims empirically.

## üß™ Methodology

### 1. üìö Literature Review
A preliminary review of 150 publications was conducted using the terms:

- `Latin American modern architecture` + `daylight`, `thermal`, `cooling`
- Sources were filtered by title relevance, abstract content, and full review readiness.

> See `data/lit_review_summary.csv` for full screening data.

### 2. üèõÔ∏è Building Selection

From 48 projects in the 1955 MoMA catalog, 6 were selected based on:

- **Program**: collective housing
- **Climate**: K√∂ppen Aw (tropical savanna)

| Project | Architect(s) | City | Year |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Pedregulho | Eduardo Affonso Reidy | Rio de Janeiro | 1950 |
| Unidade de Habita√ß√£o | Guido Bermudez | Caracas | 1954 |
| Multicelulares | Bermudez & Villanueva | Caracas | 1954 |
| Antonio Ceppas | Jorge Machado Moreira | Rio de Janeiro | 1952 |
| Cintra, Bristol & Caled√¥nia | L√∫cio Costa | Rio de Janeiro | 1953 |
| Montserrat | Benacerraf & Guinand | Caracas | 1950 |

### 3. üñ•Ô∏è Simulation Procedure

All daylight simulations were performed using **Solemma‚Äôs ClimateStudio** with models created in **Rhinoceros 8** + **Grasshopper**. Scripts for facade devices are provided:

- `scripts/brise_soleil.gh`
- `scripts/musharabya.gh`

**Modeling assumptions:**

- Wall thickness: 18‚Äì25 cm
- Window height: 120 cm, sill at 105 cm
- No glazing thickness modeled
- Brise-soleil & musharabya treated via parametrized Grasshopper scripts
- All floorplates treated with open door policy
- Floor area excludes walls
- Floor albedo: 0,2

## üìä Results

Daylight performance was measured using:

- **Mean & median lux**
- **Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE)**
- **Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA)**
- **Daylight Glare Probability (DGP)**

Key findings:

- L√∫cio Costa‚Äôs and Jorge Machado‚Äôs projects (with well-proportioned brise-soleil and musharabya) perform best.
- Orientation (angle from North) plays a significant role in performance‚Äîeven without shading devices.
- High ASE and variation = poor environmental adequacy (e.g., Reidy‚Äôs Pedregulho).
